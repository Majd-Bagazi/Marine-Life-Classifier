# Marine Life Classifier
 Description
This is an image classification project built using Teachable Machine by Google. The model is trained to recognize and classify images into one of the following three categories:

 Ducks

 Dolphins

 Turtles

It uses machine learning techniques to detect visual patterns from image samples and predict the correct class for any new image provided.

 Model Training
Tool used: Teachable Machine

Training method: Image classification

Total classes: 3

Samples per class: 5 images (manually uploaded)

ðŸ“‚ Classes & Samples
Clss	Number of Samples	Example Images
Ducks	5	
Dolphins	5	
Turtles	5	

 How to Use
Open the exported model (via Export Model in Teachable Machine).

Upload an image or use your webcam.

The model will output the predicted class with confidence scores.

 Export Options
You can export the model for:

Web-based use (TensorFlow.js)

On-device apps (TensorFlow Lite)

Python integration (TensorFlow or Keras)

 Future Improvements
Add more image samples per class to improve accuracy.

Introduce additional marine animal categories.

Apply real-time webcam classification.
